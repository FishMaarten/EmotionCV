Challenge: Train a model to pick up on sequence of emotions through video feed

# Kaggle dataset
We used [this kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset) dataset containing ~36k images.  
The labels covered the emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise.

An accuracy of 98.3% was reached on the training set with an LSTM architecture.  
Validation on all models is rather low due to a badly labeled validation set.

# OpenCV
CV2 can be set up with a small latency which gives our model a brief window to batch the frames and process the input for a prediction.
